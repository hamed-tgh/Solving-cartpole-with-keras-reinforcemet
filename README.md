# Solving-cartpole-with-keras-rl



#  Each R.L algorithm consists of 4 different level which are 1.Action 2.Reward 3.Environment and 4.Agent or in brief AREA.

in this project we seek to solve cartpole-v1 game which presented from OPEN-AI 
in this game we have only 2 ations, right and left and have to balance the stick.

first of all we have to import this environment from Gym, created by OPEN_AI, then we setup a learning model by using keras, an api of Tensorflow. Finally, by using keras-rl we train the model.
